# Burger Graphics

Checkout the documentation. C graphics is really interesting, and can get quite complex. While the use case and implementation is rather simple, there are some 
really cool things that are possible with even simple library's such as this. 



## Why its called Burger Graphics

While watching Bob's Burgers Season 15, Episode 1, I was surprised to see a young elementary school student developing a video game. Given the age of the computers, I assumed the kid was likely using a C-based language. My first thought was, "There's no way a kid could pull this off!" Even I would need to do quite a bit of research to tackle something like that.

So, I decided to take on the challenge myself.

And that's how this project came to be!

## Projects within this Project

First and foremost the main purpose of this project was to create a game similar to the one present in bobs burgers. This will be considered a seperate project
from this library. This will eliminate unneeded portions for regular library use. 

Another project that will be contained within this project will be an image to block converted. Essentially it will be able to convert a pixel art image (or any image, however it will be significantly downscaled)
into an interpretable format for our "game engine" to use.
